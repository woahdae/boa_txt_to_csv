# Bank of America txt to CSV

For some reason, BOA stopped offering CSV statement downloads for 2013
credit cards, or at least hid the link well, and my Dad needed to get it
into a CSV format. Thus, this script.

This parses an 'eStmt' text file and outputs a CSV containing the columnar
data.

This will not be maintained, and is a pile, but it worked, and I'd
rather keep the code on github instead of my local box.

Your mileage may vary, don't hold me accountable, I make no garuntees,
check that it works, etc. Maybe it'll save you the couple hours it took
me.
